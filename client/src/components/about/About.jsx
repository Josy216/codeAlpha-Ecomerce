          <strong>Jocode Store</strong> is a specialized e-commerce platform focused on providing high-quality, beginner-friendly, and practical tech courses.

          <h2>Why Jocode is Different</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional learning platforms, Jocode is built by learners, for learners. We focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Affordability ‚Äî low cost or free access to high-quality resources.</li>
          <li>Practicality ‚Äî hands-on coding projects and examples.</li>
          <li>Transparency ‚Äî clear course outcomes and future skill maps.</li>
          <li>Scalability ‚Äî instructors (like you in the future) can add new courses dynamically.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

          <h2>Ecommerce? Yes, But Reimagined.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          While this project is labeled as an "ecommerce site," we've reimagined it to sell digital knowledge instead of physical items. Every course has
          a price (even if it's free), a checkout experience, a student dashboard, and access to community support. This aligns perfectly with ecommerce concepts while
          serving long-term educational value.

        <p>
          Jocode will expand to include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>User dashboards to track progress.</li>
          <li>Instructor accounts for uploading courses.</li>
          <li>Certificate generation after course completion.</li>
          <li>Community Q&A and mentorship features.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
